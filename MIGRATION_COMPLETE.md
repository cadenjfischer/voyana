# Clerk to Supabase Auth Migration - COMPLETE ✅

## Migration Summary
Successfully migrated from Clerk authentication to Supabase Auth to resolve production deployment issues.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Authentication Infrastructure
- ✅ Created `src/lib/supabase/auth.ts` with server-side helpers
  - `getUser()`: Returns authenticated user or null
  - `getUserId()`: Returns user ID
  - `requireAuth()`: Throws if unauthenticated
- ✅ Updated `src/middleware.ts` to use Supabase session validation
- ✅ Replaced Clerk provider in `src/app/layout.tsx`

### 2. Sign-In/Sign-Up Pages
- ✅ Created `src/app/sign-in/page.tsx` (email/password authentication)
- ✅ Created `src/app/sign-up/page.tsx` (registration with validation)
- ✅ Created `src/app/user-profile/page.tsx` (profile management)

### 3. API Routes
- ✅ Updated `src/app/api/trips/route.ts` (GET, POST)
- ✅ Updated `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` (GET, PATCH, DELETE)

### 4. UI Components
- ✅ Updated `src/components/Header.tsx` with custom user menu
  - Real-time auth state subscription
  - Custom avatar with email initial
  - Profile and sign-out functionality

### 5. Environment Variables
- ✅ Removed 6 Clerk variables from `.env.local`
- ✅ Removed 6 Clerk variables from `env-for-vercel.txt`
- ✅ Kept Supabase variables:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Next Steps (IMPORTANT - DO THESE BEFORE TESTING)

### 1. Stop Dev Server & Uninstall Clerk
```bash
# Make sure dev server is stopped (Ctrl+C if running)
npm uninstall @clerk/nextjs @clerk/clerk-react @clerk/shared
npm install
```

### 2. Enable Supabase Email Auth
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wuzchhdrgejmtcqdexkp
2. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Providers**
3. **Enable Email provider**
4. **IMPORTANT - Disable email confirmation for easier testing:**
   - Go to **Authentication** → **Email Templates**
   - OR in **Settings** → **Auth** → scroll to "Email Auth"
   - Toggle OFF "Enable email confirmations"
   - This allows users to sign in immediately after sign-up without confirming email
   - (You can re-enable this later for production)

### 3. Local Testing
```bash
npm run dev
```
Test these flows:
- [ ] Sign up with new email/password
- [ ] Sign in with credentials
- [ ] Visit protected routes (/dashboard, /user-profile, /itinerary)
- [ ] Sign out
- [ ] Create/edit/delete trips

### 4. Build & Deploy
```bash
# Test production build locally
npm run build
npm start

# Deploy to Vercel
# Update environment variables in Vercel dashboard first!
```

### 5. Vercel Environment Variables
**DELETE these 6 variables:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL`

**KEEP these variables:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`

## Protected Routes
- `/dashboard` - Redirects to `/sign-in` if not authenticated
- `/user-profile` - User profile management
- `/itinerary` - Trip itineraries (all paths)

## Auth Routes
- `/sign-in` - Redirects to `/dashboard` if already authenticated
- `/sign-up` - Redirects to `/dashboard` if already authenticated

## Authentication Flow
1. User visits protected route
2. Middleware checks Supabase session
3. If no session → redirect to `/sign-in`
4. User signs in → session cookie set
5. Middleware validates session on every request
6. User can access protected routes

## Troubleshooting

### "Email not confirmed" error
- Go to Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Users
- Find your test user and manually confirm their email
- Or disable email confirmation in Auth settings

### Session not persisting
- Clear browser cookies
- Check that cookies are being set in middleware
- Verify Supabase URL and anon key are correct

### Build errors
- Make sure `@clerk/nextjs` is fully uninstalled
- Delete `.next` folder: `rm -rf .next`
- Rebuild: `npm run build`

## Migration Benefits
✅ Simpler authentication (no external service dependency for middleware)
✅ Consolidated with existing Supabase database
✅ No more MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED errors
✅ Better local development experience
✅ Cost savings (one service instead of two)

## Files to Delete (Optional Cleanup)
- `CLERK_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (no longer needed)
- `fix-clerk.sh` (Clerk-specific script)
- Old Clerk-related directories in `.next/` will be cleaned on rebuild
